    Rabbits are mammals, which is an animal that
    has warm blood and backbones. They are small,
    fluffy animals with short tails that look like a ball.
    They have long ears and whiskers. Their long legs
    let them hop around quickly. They can weigh one
    pound or even up to 16 pounds! Rabbits can live
    for about 10 years. Some people call rabbits
    bunnies, but they are the same. A female rabbit is called a doe while a male
    rabbit is called a buck.
    Rabbits have lots of babies, which are called kits.
    Kits are born without fur and canâ€™t see. When the
    babies are 5 weeks old, they can live on their
    own. Rabbits can make their own families at 2 to
    3 months old.
